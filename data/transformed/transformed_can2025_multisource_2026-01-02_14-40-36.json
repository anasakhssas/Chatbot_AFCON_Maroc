The situation has been further complicated by the addition of two extra match days scheduled for the last two weeks of January in the expanded2025–26 UEFA Champions Leagueseason.\n\nThis edition of the tournament was scheduled to be the second after2019to take place during the northern hemisphere's summer (June–July), in order to reduce scheduling conflicts with European club teams and competitions;the previous2023 editionwas moved to January and February 2024 owing to the adverse summer weather conditions in Ivory Coast.Guineawas originally set as hosts for this edition of the tournament, but had its hosting rights stripped after affirming its inadequacy of hosting preparations.After a second bidding process,Morocco was named as the new hosts on 27 September 2023.Ivory Coastarethe defending champions.\n\nCAF stripped Cameroon from hostingthe 2019 editionof the tournament on 30 November 2018 due to lack of speed of progress in preparations,but accepted former CAF presidentAhmad Ahmad's request to stagethe next edition in 2021. Consequently, the original hosts of 2021, Ivory Coast, became hosts ofthe 2023 editionwith Guinea instead hosting the 2025 edition, which until then had no hosts.The CAF President confirmed the timetable shift after a meeting with Ivorian presidentAlassane OuattarainAbidjan, Ivory Coast on 30 January 2019.On 30 September 2022, current CAF president Patrice Motsepe announced thatGuineahad been stripped as host for the 2025 edition due to inadequacy and speed of progress in hosting preparations.Consequently, a new process was re-opened for a replacement host bidder.On 27 September 2023, the 2025 edition was awarded toMoroccoand the 2027 edition toKenya,Tanzania, andUganda.\n\nThe tournament mascot, named Assad (Arabic:أسد), was revealed on 8 December 2025. It is aBarbary lion, a reference to Morocco's national animal and nickname of thenational team of Morocco.\n\nOn 10 November 2025, CAF andPumaunveiled \"Itri\" (Standard Moroccan Amazigh:ⵉⵜⵔⵉ,lit.'star') as the official tournament edition match ball. The ball, covered inzellijart in red and green, is influenced by an ancient mosaic tradition known for its complex geometric decoration and reflects the shared spirit and enthusiasm of football across Africa. Produced by Puma using Orbital 6 technology, the design combines star-based forms, floral motifs and circular patterns, conveying joy and the coming together of the 24 nations taking part in the tournament.\n\nThe official song is \"Africallez\" which stands as one of the tournament's emblems,fusing sporting fervor, cultural identity, and a message of continental unity. Conceived as a true Pan-African anthem, \"Africallez\" is performed by three artists whose styles complement each other perfectly: Beninese divaAngélique Kidjo, a global icon of African music; French-Moroccan singerLartiste, a key figure in the urban and international music scenes; and Moroccan artist Jaylane, who symbolizes the country's new artistic generation.\n\nThe winners will receive US$10 million, an increase from US$7 million for the 2023 event.\n\n\n📊 TABLEAU 1:\nOfficial Title Sponsor | Official Global Partners | Official Competition Sponsors | Official Suppliers\nTotalEnergies | 1xBet European Union Orange Group Puma Royal Air Maroc Suzuki Tecno Mobile Visa Inc. | Apsonic Danone Konami ( eFootball ) LONACI Midea Group Morocco Now OCP Group ONCF Unilever ( Rexona ) Visit Morocco | Acıbadem Healthcare Group Africa Global Logistics Bel Group ( The Laughing Cow ) Sidi Ali\n\n📊 TABLEAU 2:\nTeam | Qualification method | Date of qualification | Appearance(s) | Previous best performance | WR\nTotal | First | Last | Streak\nMorocco | Hosts / Group B winners | 27 September 2023 | 20th | 1972 | 2023\nBurkina Faso | Group L runners-up | 13 October 2024 | 14th | 1978 | 2023\nCameroon | Group J winners | 14 October 2024 | 22nd | 1970 | 2023\nAlgeria | Group E winners | 14 October 2024 | 21st | 1968 | 2023\nDR Congo | Group H winners | 15 October 2024 | 21st | 1965 | 2023\nSenegal | Group L winners | 15 October 2024 | 18th | 1965 | 2023\nEgypt | Group C winners | 15 October 2024 | 27th | 1957 | 2023\nAngola | Group F winners | 15 October 2024 | 10th | 1996 | 2023\nEquatorial Guinea | Group E runners-up | 13 November 2024 | 5th | 2012 | 2023\nIvory Coast | Group G runners-up | 13 November 2024 | 26th | 1965 | 2023\nGabon | Group B runners-up | 14 November 2024 | 9th | 1994 | 2021\nUganda | Group K runners-up | 14 November 2024 | 8th | 1962 | 2019\nSouth Africa | Group K winners | 14 November 2024 | 12th | 1996 | 2023\n\n📊 LIST OF HOST CITIES AND STADIUMS:\nCity | Stadium | Capacity | Image\nAgadir | Adrar Stadium | 45,000 | \nCasablanca | Stade Mohammed V | 45,000 | \nFez | Fez Stadium | 45,000 | \nMarrakesh | Marrakesh Stadium | 45,000 | \nRabat | Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium | 69,500 | \nMoulay Hassan Stadium | 22,000 | \nRabat Olympic Stadium | 21,000 | \nAl Medina Stadium | 18,000 | \nTangier | Tangier Grand Stadium | 75,000 | \n\n📊 REFEREEING TEAMS:\nCountry | Referee | Assistant referees | Matches assigned\nAlgeria | Mustapha Ghorbal | Mahmoud Ahmed Abouelregal Jerson Emiliano Dos Santos [ de ] [ a ] | Ivory Coast–Cameroon ( Group F )\nLahlou Benbraham [ de ; uk ] | Abbes Akram Zerhouni [ de ] Adel Abane [ a ] | Senegal–DR Congo ( Group D )\nBenin | Djindo Louis Houngnandande [ de ] | Aymar Ulrich Eric Ayimavo [ a ] Mohammed Abdallah Ibrahim [ de ] [ a ] | Uganda–Nigeria ( Group C )\nBurundi | Pacifique Ndabihawenimana | Djibril Camara [ de ; no ] [ a ] Nouha Bangoura [ a ] | Egypt–South Africa ( Group B )\nCameroon | Abdou Abdel Mefire | Moutsassi Styven Danek [ a ] Yanes Malondi Chani [ a ] | Morocco–Mali ( Group A )\nChad | Mahamat Alhadji Allaou [ fr ] | Elvis Guy Noupue Nguegoue [ a ] Amos Abeigne Ndong [ a ] | Comoros–Mali ( Group A )\nCongo | Messie Jessie Oved Nkounkou Mvoutou | Moutsassi Styven Danek [ a ] Yanes Malondi Chani [ a ] | Equatorial Guinea–Sudan ( Group E )\nDR Congo | Jean-Jacques Ndala Ngambo | Guylain Nguila Gradel Mbilizi Mwanya | Morocco–Comoros ( Group A ) Tanzania–Tunisia ( Group C )\nEgypt | Mohamed Mansour Maarouf | Khalil Hassani [ de ] [ a ] Ahmed Hossameldin Taha [ de ] [ a ] | Burkina Faso–Equatorial Guinea ( Group E )\nAmin Mohamed Omar | Mahmoud Ahmed Abouelregal [ a ] Adel Abane [ a ] | Cameroon–Gabon ( Group F )\nGabon | Pierre Ghislain Atcho [ de ; uk ] | Elvis Guy Noupue Nguegoue [ a ] Carine Atezambong Fomo [ fr ; de ] [ a ] | Algeria–Sudan ( Group E )\nTanguy Patrice Mebiame [ de ; uk ] | Boris Marlaise Ditsoga [ de ] Amos Abeigne Ndong [ a ] | Tunisia–Uganda ( Group C )\nGhana | Daniel Nii Ayi Laryea | Zakhele Siwela [ a ] Souru Phatsoane [ a ] | Algeria–Burkina Faso ( Group E )\nIvory Coast | Clement Franklin Kpan | Dimbiniaina Andriatianarivelo [ de ] [ a ] Jonathan Koffi Ahonto [ fr ; de ] [ a ] | Angola–Egypt ( Group B )\n\n📊 TABLEAU 5:\nPot 1 | Pot 2 | Pot 3 | Pot 4\nMorocco (hosts) Senegal Egypt Algeria Nigeria Ivory Coast (holders) | Cameroon Mali Tunisia South Africa DR Congo Burkina Faso | Gabon Angola Zambia Uganda Equatorial Guinea Benin | Mozambique Comoros Tanzania Sudan Zimbabwe Botswana",
